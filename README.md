# **Uber Trip Data Analysis & Visualization**

---

## **Project Overview**
The primary goal was to transform raw Uber trip data into a clean, structured format and then analyze it to understand trip patterns, user behavior, and key metrics. The analysis focuses on understanding factors like trip mileage, purpose, and distribution.

---

## **Key Steps & Skills**
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Used Python and Pandas to clean the dataset (fixing missing values, converting date/time columns, handling nulls in `MILES` and `PURPOSE`). This ensured the data was reliable for analysis.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Analyzed trip distributions, categories, and start/stop locations to guide visualization choices.  

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Created pie charts, bar charts, boxplots, and scatterplots with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to capture key insights.  

---

## **Insights & Findings**
- A significant portion of trips were for **business purposes**.  
- Most trips were **short (0â€“10 miles)**, but longer trips for Customer Visits and Commutes contributed heavily to total mileage.  
- **Meeting, Customer Visit, and Temporary Site** were the top three trip purposes by total miles.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Expand analysis with larger datasets for **customer segmentation**.  
- Include **external factors** like weather or time of day.  
- Model the impact of **surge pricing** on trip behavior.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** (data visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis environment)
