Uber Trip Data Analysis & Visualization
Project Overview

The primary goal was to transform raw Uber trip data into a clean, structured format and then analyze it to understand trip patterns, user behavior, and key metrics. The analysis focuses on understanding factors like trip mileage, purpose, and distribution.

<u>Key Steps & Skills</u>

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The initial dataset had missing and inconsistent values. I used Python and Pandas to clean the data, converting date/time columns to the correct format and handling missing entries in columns like MILES and PURPOSE. This ensured the data was reliable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed a deep dive into the data to understand its structure and content. This involved analyzing the distribution of trips, categories, and unique start/stop locations to inform the visualization strategy.

Data Visualization: I tackled the challenge of visualizing numerous categorical variables by creating a variety of effective charts. Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I generated visuals such as pie charts, bar charts, boxplots, and scatterplots.

<u>Insights & Findings</u>

A significant portion of trips were for business purposes.

The majority of trips were relatively short (0-10 miles), though longer trips for purposes like Customer Visit and Commute accounted for a substantial amount of total mileage.

Meeting, Customer Visit, and Temporary Site were identified as the top three trip purposes by total miles driven.

<u>Future Enhancements</u>

With a larger dataset, this project could be expanded to include:

Customer segmentation to identify different user groups.

Analysis of the impact of external factors like weather and time of day on trip patterns.

Modeling the effects of surge pricing on trip behavior.

<u>Tech Stack</u>
